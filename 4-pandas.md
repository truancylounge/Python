### Intro to Pandas
1. Pandas stands for Python Data Analysis Library, that provides high performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
2. Two types of Data structures in Pandas:
    - **Series**, One dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type(integers, floats, strings etc)
    - **DataFrame**, A two-dimensional labeled data structure, like a table or spreadsheet with rows and columns
3. Data Ingestion and Manipulation
    - **Reading Data**, Pandas seamlessly reads data form various sources such as CSV, Excel, SQl databases etc
    - **Transform Data**, Powerful methods to clean, restructure, manipulate data i.e. renaming columns, merging data from various sources etc
4. Summarize data using methods like mean, median, standard deviation and percentiles to gain initial insights
5. Pandas integrate seamlessly with matplotlib, seaborn and other visualization libraries to create insightful charts and graphs
6. Indexing and Selection i.e. Accessing and Filtering Data
    - Retrieve data by column names and row labels
    - Access data using integer positions i.e. first row, third column etc
    - Filter rows or columns based on logical conditions
7. Data Wrangling i.e. Grouping, Aggregating and Pivoting Data
    - Group data by one or more columns to perform calculations within each group
    - Aggregate data within groups using functions like sum, mean, count etc. to get summary statistics
8. Time Series Analysis i.e. Working with Dates and Times Information
    - Pandas handles dates and times as special data types, providing robust tools for working with time series data
    - Perform time series operations such as resampling, rolling calculations, and frequency conversions
9. Pandas integration with other libraries to create a comprehensive data science toolkit:
    - matplotlib (visualization)
    - seaborn (statistical visualization)
    - scikit-learn (machine learning)
